# Inpoint-Local-Positioning-System
Inpoint is a BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) based local positioning system. The main function of this device is to perform tracking similar to the technology we know as GPS, but indoors. The main device that is the focus of this research is the Devkitm1-ESP32-C3, where the results of the experiments can be seen so that optimization can be performed to enable accurate tracking. This current version is to test the functionality of the project where the ESP32-C3 can pickup and differentiate between two rooms.
